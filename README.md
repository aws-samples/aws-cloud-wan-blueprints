# Traffic Inspection Architectures with AWS Cloud WAN

This repository contains code (in AWS CloudFormation and Terraform) to deploy several inspection architectures using AWS Cloud WAN - with AWS Network Firewall as inspection solution. The use cases covered are the following ones:

* Centralized Outbound.
* East/West traffic, with both Spoke VPCs and Inspection VPCs attached to AWS Cloud WAN.
* East/West traffic, with both Spoke VPCs and Inspection VPCs attached to AWS Transit Gateway and peered with AWS Cloud WAN.
* East/West traffic, with Spoke VPCs attached to a peered AWS Transit Gateway and Inspection VPCs attached to AWS Cloud WAN.

In all the examples we are deploying resources in three AWS Regions: N. Virginia (us-east-1), Ireland (eu-west-1), and Sydney (ap-southeast-2)

## Use cases

### Centralized Outbound

* 1 segment per routing domain, plus 1 segment for the post-inspection (*security* in the example)
* Spoke VPCs are attached to the corresponding segment, and the Inspection VPCs to the *security* segment.
* In each routing domain's segment, there's a static route (0.0.0.0/0) pointing to the Inspection VPC attachments. Traffic will be routed to the local Inspection VPC attachment.
* Routing domain's segments share their routes with the *security* segment, so the return traffic can reach the proper VPC.

    }
  ]
}
```

### East/West traffic, with both Spoke VPCs and Inspection VPCs attached to AWS Cloud WAN.

* 1 segment per routing domain, plus 1 segment for the post-inspection per AWS Region.
  * In the example we are creating resources in 3 AWS Regions, so 3 *security* segments are needed.
  * Each Inspection VPC will be attached to a dedicated *security* segment, although all segments need to be created in all the AWS Regions (so they can reach all the Spoke VPCs).
* In each routing domain's segment, there's a static route (0.0.0.0/0) pointing to the Inspection VPC attachments. 
  * Traffic will be routed to the local Inspection VPC attachment.
  * VPCs within the same segment can talk between each other by default. If you want inter-routing domain traffic inspection, create an isolated segment.
* Static routes are created in each AWS Region *security* segment. 
  * These static routes point to the other AWS Region Inspection VPC attachments when the traffic is destined to the Spoke VPCs of that specific AWS Region.
  * Inter-region traffic needs to be inspected twice (in both Inspection VPCs) to avoid asymmetric traffic.
* Routing domain's segments share their routes with the *security* segment, so the return traffic can reach the proper VPC - when doing intra-Region inspection.

### East/West traffic, with both Spoke VPCs and Inspection VPCs attached to AWS Transit Gateway and peered with AWS Cloud WAN.

* Spoke VPCs and Inspection VPC in each AWS Region are attached to the Transit Gateway.
  * Spoke VPC attachments are associated with a *pre-inspection* route table with a static route (0.0.0.0/0) pointing to the Inspection VPC.
  * Inspection VPC attachment is associated with a *post-inspection* route table.
  * A third route table (*cross-region*) contains a static route with destination the Spoke VPC CIDR blocks pointing to the Inspection VPC. This route(s) will be used to enforce the inspection of traffic coming from another AWS Region.
  * Spoke VPCs propagate to the *post-inspection* route table.
* In the Core Network, per AWS Region there are two segments: *post-inspection* and *cross-region*. Two Transit Gateway Route Table attachments are created per AWS Region, connecting the corresponding route tables and segments.
  * The *cross-region* segment will get propagated the static route from the *cross-region* route table (access to the Inspection VPC of that AWS Region). Each *cross-region* segment will share this route with the *post-inspection* segments in the other AWS Regions.
  * The *post-inspection* segment will propagate this route shared by the *cross-region* segment to the *post-inspection* route table. That way, when traffic needs to traverse two AWS Regions, it will be inspected in both AWS Regions - and asymmetric traffic will be avoided.

  ]
}
```

### East/West traffic, with Spoke VPCs attached to a peered AWS Transit Gateway and Inspection VPCs attached to AWS Cloud WAN.

* Spoke VPCs in each AWS Region are attached to the Transit Gateway.
  * The VPC attachments are associated with a *pre-inspection* route table, which gets propagated the route to the local Inspection VPC via the peering with the Core Network.
  * The VPC attachments propagate their routes to a *post-inspection* route table, propagating these routes to the Core Network via the peering.
* The Inspection VPCs are attached to the Core Network.
* In the Core Network there are two type of segments:
  * One *pre-inspection* segment with a static route (0.0.0.0/0) to the Inspection VPCs.
  * One *post-inspection* segment per AWS Region, where each Inspection VPC attachment will be associated. In each segment, the local Spoke VPC CIDRs will be propagated from the peering with the Transit Gateway.
  * In each *post-inspection* segment, a static route to the other AWS Region CIDRs (pointing to that AWS Region Inspection VPC) is created. That way, inter-Region traffic is inspected in both AWS Regions - avoiding asymmetric traffic.
